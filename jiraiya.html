            Jiraiya (自来也) was one of Konohagakure's Sannin. Famed as a hermit and pervert of stupendous ninja skill,
            Jiraiya travelled the world in search of knowledge that would help his friends, the various novels he wrote,
            and, posthumously, the world in its entirety – knowledge that would be passed on to his godson and final
            student, Naruto Uzumaki.

            Jiraiya appears in two Naruto films, and as a playable character in most of the franchise's video games.
            Various pieces of merchandise based on him have been released. He has received positive critical reception.
            Reviewers have praised Jiraiya's introduction in the story and his relation with Naruto as his mentor. Out
            of all student-teacher relationships in Naruto, Jiraiya and Naruto's are the ones Kishimoto liked the most.
            He served as a strong father-figure to Naruto.
