            Gaara (我愛羅, Gaara) is a shinobi of Sunagakure. He was made the jinchūriki of the One-Tailed Shukaku before
            he was born, causing the villagers of Suna to fear him as a monster. With nobody to connect to, Gaara grew
            up hating the world and looking out only for himself, giving his life meaning by killing anyone he came
            across. After being defeated by Naruto Uzumaki — a jinchūriki like himself who found strength in his
            friendships — Gaara starts emulating him. He becomes Suna's Fifth Kazekage (五代目風影, Godaime Kazekage,
            literally meaning: Fifth Wind Shadow) so that he can protect the village and all those who live there,
            dispelling the fears he cast on the villagers.

            Gaara was created a foil to the series' eponymous character, Naruto Uzumaki, as the two were born through
            similar circumstances, but develop vastly different personalities due to a troubled upbringing. His designs
            and name underwent major changes in the making of his final one which also was modified in later arcs to
            give Gaara a design that is easier to draw. In the Japanese version of the series, Gaara is voiced by Akira
            Ishida while Liam O'Brien voices him in the English dub. </p>
