            Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the
            Sharingan (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to
            for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi
            emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his
            childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage
            (六代目火影, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).

            Kakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that.
            Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him
            feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered
            and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue
            in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub. </p>
