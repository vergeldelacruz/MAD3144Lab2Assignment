            Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu
            Captain. He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger
            brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose
            activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to
            avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
            complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village,
            making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end

            Itachi's character has been popular with readers of the manga,[6] and has been positively received by
            critics. His appearance as an antagonist has been praised by several writers, although some have considered
            his initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact on the story
            has also received positive reception,[7][8] and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in the
            series.[9][10][11] Numerous types of merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including
            keychains, plush dolls and figurines.</p>
